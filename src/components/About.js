             <div className="description">Bite-Box is more than just a food and meal-planning app—it's my personal journey into mastering React and JavaScript. 
             This project is a hands-on way for me to explore every detail of React, from component-based architecture to state management, 
             routing, and beyond.</div>
             <h2 className="reason">Why I Built Bite-Box</h2>
             <div className="reason-answer">I created Bite-Box as a learning experience to dive deep into modern web development. Through this project, I'm not just building an app; I'm understanding how React works at its core, 
             experimenting with JavaScript concepts, and improving my frontend skills.</div>
             <h2 className="learnings">What I'm Learning</h2>
             <p className="learning-answer">As I develop Bite-Box, I'm implementing and documenting key React and JavaScript features, including:
                    ✅ React Components & Props
                    ✅ State Management (useState, useReducer, Context API)
                    ✅ React Router & Navigation
                    ✅ Fetching Data & API Integration
                    ✅ Performance Optimization (useMemo, useCallback)
                    ✅ JavaScript Concepts like Closures, Promises, and Async/Await
                    ✅ Module Bundlers: Webpack & Parcel for optimizing builds
                    ✅ Shimmer UI: Implementing skeleton loaders for better UX
                    ✅ CORS Policy: Understanding and handling cross-origin requests
             </p>
             <h2>My Goals</h2>
             <div>Bite-Box is a work in progress, constantly evolving as I explore 
             new concepts and best practices. If you're interested in React, JavaScript, or just love to see projects grow, 
             feel free to follow along!
