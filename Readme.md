🚀 Just launched: Bite-Box – My React Learning Playground! 🍱⚛️

For the past few weeks, I’ve been deep-diving into React, not just building UIs but really understanding how it works under the hood.

So I built Bite-Box-FoodExpress, a project where I experiment, break things, and rebuild — all to sharpen my frontend skills.
From React fundamentals to advanced concepts like:

🧠 Virtual DOM diffing

🛠️ Parcel vs Webpack bundling

🌊 Shimmer UI for skeleton loading

💥 CORS issues (the eternal frontend villain)

🎨 Tailwind conversions inside className

And yes, documenting everything along the way 📝
Because it’s not just about building — it’s about understanding.

This isn’t a portfolio piece — it’s a learning lab 💻
If you're exploring React or love diving deep into frontend performance, let’s connect and share notes! 🔍

Would love your thoughts and suggestions 🙌
